    "\n",
    "This notebook covers the Stage 3 processing of the spectroscopic mode data calibration module. In this notebook we'll review Stage 3 of the JWST calibration pipeline for spectroscopic data, also known as *calwebb_spec3*. This notebook will not address spectroscopic Time Series Observation (TSO) calibration, which is handled by a separate pipeline, [*calwebb_tso3*](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/pipeline/calwebb_tso3.html#calwebb-tso3).\n",
    "\n",
    "The [*calwebb_spec3* pipeline](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/stable/jwst/pipeline/calwebb_spec3.html) takes one or more calibrated slope images (`*_cal.fits` files) stored in an association file (detailed [below](#associations)) and outputs 1D spectra for all modes, and 2D or 3D spectral products for some modes. The steps performed in order to reach these final products varies with spectroscopic mode. Wide-Field Slitless Spectroscopy (WFSS) and non-TSO SOSS modes are minimally processed by *calwebb_spec3*, while NIRSpec and MIRI modes undergo more correction steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "1D extracted spectral products, with suffix *_x1d*, and are produced for all spectroscopic modes. Combined 1D spectral products, with suffix *_c1d* are produced for WFSS and non-TSO SOSS modes. \n",
    "\n",
    "All JWST spectroscopy mode data, except TSO SOSS data, are processed through the *calwebb_spec3* pipeline. The pipeline is a wrapper which will string together the appropriate steps for each exposure in the proper order."

    "This step uses the collection of input files to identify and flag any cosmic rays or other transient image artifacts that were not flagged by the jump step in calwebb_detector1. While the jump step looked for large pixel-based deviations in the signal from group-to-group within an integration, the outlier detection step looks for large sky-based exposure-to-exposure devations in the signal. If a given location on the sky shows no signal above the noise in 4 out of 5 exposures, but a bright source in the remaining exposure, the outlier detction step will flag in the DQ map the pixels containing the source in the fifth exposure. These pixels will be ignored when the exposures are later combined into a final mosaic image.\n",
